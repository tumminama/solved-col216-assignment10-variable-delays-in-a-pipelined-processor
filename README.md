Variable Delays in a Pipelined Processor

Sometimes, operations such as floating point arithmetic or memory accesses in a pipelined processor require variable delays. A floating point computation may depend on the data operands. A memory access may exhibit variable delays due to the cache hierarchy. Let us try to model the memory architecture by introducing a data memory that works as follows:

<ol>

 <li>The operation completes in one cycle with a probability x (this is considered a HIT).</li>

 <li>The operation requires N cycles with a probability 1-x (this is considered a MISS).</li>

 <li>Upon a memory request, at end of one cycle, the memory indicates whether the operation was a HIT or MISS. If HIT, the operation is complete. If not, the operation completes N-1 cycles later.</li>

</ol>

Implement this variable delay feature in your pipeline. Demonstrate the pipelineâ€™s working for different values of x and N.
